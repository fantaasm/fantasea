That means game difficulty can be dynamically adjusted to be harder or easier depending on preferences. </p> <h3 id=\"who-is-for\">Who is CD for</h3> <p> The mod can be played by both casual and hardcore gamers, however to get the best experience it&apos;s recommended to find players with similar skill level. </p> <h3 id=\"common-terms\">Common terms</h3> <p>There are few terms commonly used in CD</p> <ul> <li><code>Max monsters</code> – Maximum concurrently alive monsters</li> <li><code>Spawn pool</code> – Interval between monsters spawns</li> <li><code>Cohort size</code> – Amount of monsters that spawns every <code>Spawn pool</code></li> <li><code>Spawn cycle</code> – Defines type of monsters that spawns in written order</li> </ul> <p> Knowing what setting controls what, players can adjust them accordingly to achieve the environment they want. The most game changing are <code>Spawn cycle</code> and <code>Max monsters</code>, which sets the pace of the game. </p> <h3 id=\"download\">Download</h3> <p>CD is public on <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2052571175\">Steam Workshop</a>, and it does way more than described in here including game-altering changes, check the workshop page for more info.</p> <h3 id=\"example-footage\">Example footage</h3> <p>Example footage recorded by my friend and teammate</p> <div className=\"overflow-hidden\"> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdphVThxkMw\" > YouTube</a></div>"

        "content": "<h3 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h3> <p> The idea for the game originated from Counter Strike mod <code>KZ</code> in which the player was supposed to beat an obstacle course using movement and strafing mechanics. Checkpoints were present on the map in specific places, so the player doesn&apos;t have to start from scratch if fallen down. When reached the highest point of the map, the player would get his rank based on the time it took to reach the last checkpoint. </p> <h3 id=\"concept\">Concept</h3> <p> Maze runner tries to mimic movement mechanics from Counter Strike and it&apos;s working fairly <code>good</code>. Player movement is based on momentum and can accelerate or decelerate midair, effectively making bunny hopping and surfing a thing. </p> <h3 id=\"plans\">Plans</h3> <p>The game is expected to have 3 tiers(level design) starting from the easiest tier 1 and ending on hardest tier 3 with more intense obstacles and ramps. Obstacle movement is based on a waypoint system in which each waypoint represents the next position and rotation, this generic approach allows making many obstacle variants and with some tweaks it will be enough for most cases.</p> <video controls=\"true\"> <source autostart=\"false\" src=\"/maze-runner-obstacles.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /> </video> <h3 id=\"progress\">Progress</h3> <p>At the moment, the game is in early stage of development with a playable prototype.
